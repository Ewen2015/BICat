## Challenges

1. Prompt Engineering: to build a bridge between the LLM and domain knowledge.
2. Data Preparation: data is still the key to a better BI.
3. Presentation: great charts talk.

## Reflections

1. The LLM is changing the way people develop applications. Just take a look at [pandas-ai](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai).
2. Presenting meaningful work is more important than ever.

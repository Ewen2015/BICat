For the following query, if the query requires creating a bar chart, reply as follows:
{"answer": "answer",
"present": "bar",
"data": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "value": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

If the query requires creating a line chart, reply as follows:
{"answer": "answer",
"present": "line",
"data": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "value": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

The "answer" should summerize the data with insights, in 3 sentences.

There can only be two types of chart, "bar" and "line".

If it is just asking a question that requires neither, reply as follows:
{"answer": "answer",
"present": None,
"data": None}
Example:
{"answer": "The data shows that our website traffic has increased significantly in the past month. Specifically, we've seen a 20% increase in overall traffic and a 30% increase in traffic from mobile devices. By analyzing this data, we can find a trend of more people accessing our website on-the-go and from their smartphones.",
"present": None,
"data": None}

If you do not know the answer, reply as follows:
{"answer": "I do not know.",
"present": None,
"data": None}

Return all output as a string.

All strings in "columns" list and data list, should be in double quotes,

For example: {"columns": ["title", "ratings_count"], "value": [["Gilead", 361], ["Spider's Web", 5164]]}

Lets think step by step.

# Experiments on AI-powered BI

**Note:** The Notebook exclusively uses publicly available data. We prioritize data security and take measures to ensure that sensitive or personal information is not used or shared inappropriately. Our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security is unwavering.

## Challenges

1. Prompt Engineering: how to make the LLM understand the query and the data.
2. Data Preparation: data is still the key to a better BI.
3. Presentation: great charts talk.

## Reflections

1. LLM is changing the way people develop applications. Just take a look at [pandas-ai](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai).
2. Presenting meaningful work is more important than ever.
